- title: Modularizing Rails Monoliths One Bite at a Time
  description: >-
    As Rails monoliths grow, coupling becomes increasingly difficult to
    manage. Many have reached for hope in microservices but instead found higher
    complexity. The Modular Monolith approach is a proven, lightweight
    alternative that offers the benefits of enforced boundaries without being
    cumbersome. This talk proposes a phased approach to refactoring toward this
    style using the packwerk gem.

- title: Turbo Frames Explored... for Fun and Profit
  description: >-
    The ‘new magic’ came at the end of 2020: ✨Hotwire⚡️: Stimulus, Turbo
    Streams, Strada, Turbo Drive, and Turbo Frames. Each extremely capable and
    powerful in its own right, but with a wide spread of functions and some
    overlaps, it can be tough to see what’s what. Let’s explore just one avenue:
    Turbo Frames. Let’s see what it can _really_ do.

      Greetings! I’m Jon. I’ve been in the software world for about ten years
      and continue to chase performant/efficient code while maximizing
      readability and (hopefully) minimizing bite-yourself-a-few-years-later
      code. Balance is everything! While I am a tinkering engineer, electrical
      enthusiast, digital minimalist, photographer, and reader, I’m looking
      forward to meeting you, dear reader, and finding out who YOU are! I have a
      deep love for long, slow conversations and comfy chairs — let’s find some.

- title: Go Pro with POROs
  description: >-
    Plain Old Ruby Objects (POROs) are having a moment. Maybe you’ve heard a
    whisper in the corner about the jack-of-all trades Service Object, or a
    glimmering echo of advocacy for non-database-backed domain models? Think
    you’re using them right? Afraid you’re using them wrong? Then this is the
    talk for you! We’re going to explore the wonderful world of “convention plus
    choose-your-own configuration” of Rails codebases and the shining role of
    POROs (with their ride or dies, the Module). Come hear about the diversity
    of design patterns out in the wild so you too can confidently tell your
    coworkers “let’s just use a PORO for that”.

- title: Licensing and Distributing a Paid CLI With Ruby, Rails, and SwiftUI
  description: >-
    Distributing licenses and enforcing limitations for my "Ruby on Mac" CLI was
    a super interesting and fun problem to solve. It involved tools such as
    ruby-packer, shc, Apple's DeviceCheck API, and creating a .pkg installer.
    I'll take you on that journey with me, with lessons learned and code samples.
    You'll learn tactics for thinking through similar problems, and for writing
    testable code.

    We’ve always put a lot of effort into performance at DEV
    (https://dev.to/). We want our users to be able to see their content almost
    instantaneously when interacting with our site. In order to do so we’ve
    placed emphasis on caching. We’ve had to ask ourselves questions like what
    are the right things to cache? Which layer in the stack would be best to
    cache it? And how will this affect the overall performance? During this
    presentation, I’d like to show you some of the caching strategies we have in
    place and discuss how they’ve sped up the interactions within our site.

    We’ll talk about going beyond “fat model, skinny controller” and the
    importance of following the Single Responsibility Principle. Several common
    design patterns will be discussed, but the emphasis will be on the
    importance of encapsulating your logic in whatever way you choose that makes
    the code readable and maintainable. Finally, how do you get your team on

  description: >-
    In early 2021 I made the scariest decision of my life — I decided that I was going
    to stop waiting to find a partner and instead I would have a child by myself. My
    little boy is now 1 year old, and my life path looks completely different than I
    ever thought. We all are faced with overwhelming decisions in our lives. How do
    we know what choice is right for us? Through my own journey I've developed a rubric
    for evaluating these scary choices — whether professional or personal — and I hope
    that sharing these lessons might be helpful for you.
